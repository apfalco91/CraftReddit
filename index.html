    <div class="headline"><center>Millennials Choose Reddit&#146;s Democracy Over Traditional News Sources.</center></div>

    <p>Reddit, affectionately nicknamed the "front page of the internet" by its users, is home to untold amounts of cat pictures and viral videos. But the site also provides its visitors with another popular web service: news.<br><br>

    Nearly eight-in-ten redditors use the site as a news source while almost half of Reddit users learn about the 2016 presidential campaign in a given week from the site, according to a recent Pew Research Center study conducted between January 12 and February 8, 2016.</p>

    <p>A quick primer on the fundamentals of how Reddit works: users post either original content &#45; comments or artistic content of their own creation &#45; or links to outside websites. Those posts are then either "upvoted" or "downvoted" by the community and the most successful posts rise to the top of the list for all to see.<br><br>

    There is a term for this type of community-based merit system that dates back to the days of the founding fathers: the marketplace of ideas. <br><br>

    Jennifer Frank, a professor of communication and information literacy at National University in California, believes that Reddit&#146;s adherence to this principle is what attracts users to the site. </p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>"Reddit is the perfect example of the marketplace of ideas," says Frank. "Users can contribute or take ideas, but every idea is weighted equally and there isn&#146;t any advantage given to an idea because of who has it or how much money they have. Ideas in the marketplace have equal value."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Frank, who published a dissertation titled Millennial Voters, Redditors, and News Consumption, also believes that millennials &#45; adults aged 18-34 &#45; in particular are drawn to Reddit&#146;s endless supply of news links because they trust that their peers have chosen the best articles to read.</p>

    <p>"Millennials verify everything and the research shows that," says Frank. "They know how to google and in 10 seconds have an answer."<br><br>

    With Reddit&#146;s open forums and the opinionated millennial generation contributing heavily, it should come as no surprise that politics is one of the most highly discussed topics on the site.<br><br>

    Bernie Sanders reigns supreme among the current list of presidential candidates in terms of mentions on Reddit with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump placing second and third, respectively.<br><br>

    Though considering that 69 percent of redditors are men, 56 percent are between the ages of 18 and 29, and 44 percent identify as liberal according to a separate Pew Research Center poll, the fact that Sanders dominates the comment discussions is perhaps to be expected.</p>

    <p>But Shelley Boulianne, a sociology professor at MacEwan University, is skeptical that all the internet traffic Sanders &#45; or any other candidate for that matter &#45; generates will translate directly into votes.</p>

     <blockquote>
    <p>&#34;My research suggests that social media could encourage participation in civic and political life, but its effects are impeded by how organizations and groups use social media,&#34; said Boulianne.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>She believes there is &#34;little evidence that the social media aspects of the campaigns were successful in changing people&#146;s levels of participation,&#34; according to Boulianne&#146;s study, Social Media and Participation: An Analysis of Current Research.<br><br>

    Still, in the Pew study &#45; conducted in May, June, and September of 2015 &#45; Sanders was mentioned a whopping 165,000 times, which could be a small indicator of why he has been able to survive against frontrunner Hillary Clinton.<br><br>

    With the millennial vote becoming increasingly important for the candidates vying for the White House, Reddit offers a glimpse into the mindset and priorities of these young potential voters. The candidates would be wise to pay attention.</p>
